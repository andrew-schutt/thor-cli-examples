Examples from my IRB Talk June 19th

`class_options.thor`, `hello.thor`, and `pipeline.thor` are used as examples of Thor features being leveraged. 

`quinjet.thor` and `tcgplayer.thor` are more involed applications. `quinjet.thor` was meant to mimic a scence from Thor Ragnorok (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlXBofgefhk) and `tcgplayer.thor` is a Magic card CLI searching tool.
